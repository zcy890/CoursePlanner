# CoursePlanner-WebApplication
# This is a project for CMPT 213 and was done in collaboration with Jessie Tran.
# Created a Spring Boot server which helps students plan their courses. Specifically, it will show students
when a course has been offered in the past which may help predict when it will be offered in the future.
The server was implemented to use a REST interface to support a web-based UI.
